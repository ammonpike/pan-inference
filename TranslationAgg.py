#Scores translation of words at distance 2 in PanLex database
#Score is based on the ratio of the sum tq scores of the intersection
#   of all distance 1 translations from the source word to lang3 and
#   all translations from a target word in lang2 to lang3
#   to the sum of the union of the same.
#Scores for possible translations in language 2 will be ranked.
#Example call: python3 TranslationCheck.py cat eng-000 fra-000 (smoothing) (limit to results)
